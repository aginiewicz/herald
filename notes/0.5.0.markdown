Tumblr Integration
------------------

This version of Herald is ported to use the Tumblr API for posting and
is configured to publish to [notes.implicit.ly][notes] by default. The
"notes" subdomain is the new home of implicit.ly release notes and
redirects are in place.

Upgrade and Authorization
-------------------------

You can upgrade Herald with Conscript, as usual:

    cs n8han/herald

Before publishing to notes.implicit.ly you'll need to authenticate
with a Tumblr account that is a member of the new
blog. [Send an email][nathan] requesting membership; if you had an
account with the Posterous blog you'll be added right away. Otherwise,
please include a link to a Scala project or two.

Herald authorizes directly with Tumblr so that you don't need to enter
any credentials. Run `herald` in any project directory with a `notes`
directory and click "Authorize with Tumblr" in the browser window that
opens. Approve Herald to access a signed in Tumblr account, then you
can publish also from the preview browser. (The `--publish` command
line flag also works, once you have authorized.)

Your authorization credentials are saved in `~/.herald` and may be
revoked at any time in your [Tumblr preferences][pref].
