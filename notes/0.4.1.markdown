The sbt plugin formerly known as posterous-sbt has become the
standalone application known as *herald*.

Install herald using [conscript][cs]:

    cs n8han/herald

[cs]: https://github.com/n8han/conscript#readme

Then you can preview your release notes for any project by running
`herald` in its base directory. Since herald isn't an sbt plugin with
ready access to your project settings, it assumes the notes you want
to work with are the highest numbered ones in your `notes`
directory. This is almost always the case!

Herald's preview feature opens a local browser window to a page served
by herald. If you make a change to your release notes, just save the
file and refresh. When you're done editing, hit `ctrl+c` in the
terminal that's running herald to shutdown its server.

Herald looks for your Posterous **publishing credentials** in the file
`~/.posterous` with the regular Java properties format:

    email = me@example.com
    password = mypassword

(Old-timers will recall that this was the configuration mechanism for
posterous-sbt in the halcyon days of sbt 0.7.)

After you have made a `~/.posterous` or discovered you still had one
lying around, you can publish a project's release notes from its base
directory:

    herald --publish

Just be sure you actually want to do that.
