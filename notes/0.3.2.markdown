Compatibility with sbt 0.11.0. Change your dependency declaration from
`libraryDependencies` to this:

    addSbtPlugin("net.databinder" %% "posterous-sbt" % "0.3.1")

And add an import of the plugin settings to `~/.sbt/user.sbt` or
wherever you have set your Posterous username and password. You must
apply these settings *before* setting your password and username,
otherwise they will be overriden by the defaults (`None`).

    seq(posterous.Publish.posterousSettings :_*)

    (email in Posterous) := Some("you@example.com")

    (password in Posterous) := Some("urpassword")
