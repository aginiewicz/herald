#### Updated for sbt 0.10.0

As an [sbt 0.10 plugin][plugins], posterous-sbt can be installed for
globally for your user account; there is no need to add it to
individual projects.

To instal posterous-sbt 0.2.0, you'll need to have
[Setup sbt 0.10][sbt]. You can then add posterous-sbt as a global
plugin dependency in a file such as `~/.sbt/plugins/build.sbt` :

    libraryDependencies += "net.databinder" %% "posterous-sbt" % "0.2.0"

[plugins]: https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Plugins
[sbt]: https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Setup

The plugin requires your Posterous username and password, as before,
but now it retrieves these from sbt settings. While you could specify
these for each project, it's best to make your own "plugin" that
specifies the settings globally. So in a file such as
`~/.sbt/plugins/user.scala` :

    import sbt._
    import posterous.Publish._

    object User extends Plugin {
      override def settings = Seq(
        posterousEmail := "you@example.com",
        posterousPassword := "yourpassword"
      )
    }

With that, you can run the familiar `preview-notes` and
`publish-notes` actions from the sbt 0.10 console for any project.

#### In Progress

The ability to publish versions other than the current, and to publish
manifests for all versions, has not yet been migrated.
